# contact-manager-application
Using angular and json-server, I developed this CRUD application.

Here I used seven componets : 
1. Navbar
2. Contact-Manager
3. Add-Contact 
4. Edit-Contact
5. View- Contact
6. Spinner-Contact
7. Page Not Found

*This is a CRUD applications here we can create, remove, update and delete contacts.
*Here I used ng-bootstrap for designign the full application.
*For backend I used json-server.
*This application I has a beautifull loading spinner as well.
